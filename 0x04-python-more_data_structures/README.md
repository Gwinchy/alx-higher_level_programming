Project Documentation
Overview
This project covers essential concepts in Python programming, focusing on the following topics:

Data Structures
Lambda Functions
Filter, Map, and Reduce
Contents
1. Data Structures
Understanding data structures is fundamental for efficient programming. This section introduces key data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, providing insights into their usage and advantages.

2. Lambda Functions
Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, offer a concise way to create small, throwaway functions. Learn how to use the lambda keyword and explore scenarios where lambda functions are particularly useful.

3. Filter, Map, and Reduce
These are higher-order functions in Python that operate on iterables. Gain insights into how each of these functions works:

Filter: Selectively filter elements based on a given condition.
Map: Apply a specified function to all items in an iterable, generating an iterator of the results.
Reduce: Successively apply a binary function to the items of an iterable, reducing them to a single cumulative value.
